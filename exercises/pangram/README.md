# Pangram

Determine if a sentence is a pangram. A pangram (Greek: παν γράμμα, pan gramma,
"every letter") is a sentence using every letter of the alphabet at least once.
The best known English pangram is: 
> The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.

The alphabet used consists of ASCII letters `a` to `z`, inclusive, and is case
insensitive. Input will not contain non-ASCII symbols.

## Installation
See [this guide](https://github.com/exercism/xr/blob/master/docs/INSTALLATION.md) for instructions on how to setup your local R environment.

## How to implement your solution
In each problem folder, there is a file named `<exercise_name>.R` containing a function that returns a `NULL` value. Place your implementation inside the body of the function.

## How to run tests
Inside of RStudio, simply execute the `test_<exercise_name>.R` script. This can be conveniently done with [testthat's `auto_test` function](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/testthat/topics/auto_test). Because exercism code and tests are in the same folder, use this same path for both  `code_path` and `test_path` parameters. On the command-line, you can also run `Rscript test_<exercise_name>.R`.
