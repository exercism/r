# Help

To get help if you're having trouble, you can try one of the following resources:

- [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/r) can be used to search for your problem and see if it has been answered already. You can also ask and answer questions.
- [#rstats](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23rstats) is the hashtag to use if you are asking for help or guidance on Twitter. The R community is very active on Twitter and always try to help those who are new to R.
- [/r/rstats](https://www.reddit.com/r/rstats) is the R subreddit.
- [RStudio Community](https://community.rstudio.com/) is another active and helpful R community.
