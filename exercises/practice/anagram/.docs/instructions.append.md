# Instructions append

You must return the anagrams in the same order as they are listed in the candidate words.

The instructions above refer to "lists" in the general sense and not to the `list()` data type in R.
Note that the tests for this exercise in R expect a character vector i.e. `c()` to be returned and not a `list()`.
