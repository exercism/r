# Instructions

An anagram is a rearrangement of letters to form a new word.
Given a word and a vector of candidates, return the subset of anagrams of the given word.

For example, given the subject `"listen"` and a vector of candidates like `"Enlists" "Google"
"Inlets" "Banana"` the program should return a vector containing
`"Inlets"`.

Note that the function should not return a candidate if it is the same word as the subject.
