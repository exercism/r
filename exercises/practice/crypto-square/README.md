# Crypto Square

Implement the classic method for composing secret messages called a square code.

Given an English text, output the encoded version of that text.

First, the input is normalized: the spaces and punctuation are removed
from the English text and the message is downcased.

Then, the normalized characters are broken into rows.  These rows can be
regarded as forming a rectangle when printed with intervening newlines.

For example, the sentence

> If man was meant to stay on the ground, god would have given us roots.

is normalized to:

> ifmanwasmeanttostayonthegroundgodwouldhavegivenusroots

The plaintext should be organized in to a rectangle.  The size of the
rectangle (`r x c`) should be decided by the length of the message,
such that `c >= r` and `c - r <= 1`, where `c` is the number of columns
and `r` is the number of rows.

Our normalized text is 54 characters long, dictating a rectangle with
`c = 8` and `r = 7`:

```text
ifmanwas
meanttos
tayonthe
groundgo
dwouldha
vegivenu
sroots
```

The coded message is obtained by reading down the columns going left to
right.

The message above is coded as:

```text
imtgdvsfearwermayoogoanouuiontnnlvtwttddesaohghnsseoau
```

Output the encoded text in chunks.  Phrases that fill perfect rectangles
`(r X c)` should be output `c` chunks of `r` length, separated by spaces.
Phrases that do not fill perfect rectangles will have `n` empty spaces.
Those spaces should be distributed evenly, added to the end of the last
`n` chunks.

```text
imtgdvs fearwer mayoogo anouuio ntnnlvt wttddes aohghn sseoau 
```

Notice that were we to stack these, we could visually decode the
cyphertext back in to the original message:

```text
imtgdvs
fearwer
mayoogo
anouuio
ntnnlvt
wttddes
aohghn
sseoau
```

## Installation
See [this guide](https://exercism.io/tracks/r/installation) for instructions on how to setup your local R environment.

## How to implement your solution
In each problem folder, there is a file named `<exercise_name>.R` containing a function that returns a `NULL` value. Place your implementation inside the body of the function.

## How to run tests
Inside of RStudio, simply execute the `test_<exercise_name>.R` script. This can be conveniently done with [testthat's `auto_test` function](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/testthat/topics/auto_test). Because exercism code and tests are in the same folder, use this same path for both `code_path` and `test_path` parameters. On the command-line, you can also run `Rscript test_<exercise_name>.R`.
