# Design

## Goal

The goal of this exercise is to introduce basic set operations in R.

## Learning objectives

- Understand that base R uses vectors for set operations, with no dediicated class.
- Understand the use of `%in%`, `unique()`, `union()`, `intersect()` and `setdiff()`.

## Out of scope

- Use of the `hashtable` package, though this is mentioned in `set-operations/about.md` which unlocks on completing this exercise.

## Concepts

The Concepts this exercise unlocks are:

- None.

## Prerequisites

- `vectors`
