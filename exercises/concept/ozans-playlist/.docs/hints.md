# Hints

## General

These are all short and simple tasks.
If you find yourself writing several lines of code in a function, please stop and read the introduction.

## 1. Remove duplicate tracks

- Remember that removing duplicates leaves you with the unique entries.

## 2. Check whether a track has already been added

- This is checking for inclusion, which we've already seen in previous concepts.

## 3. Add tracks

- Return tracks that are in either the playlist or the tracks to add.

## 4. Delete tracks

- Tracks which are in the playlist but not the tracks to delete.

## 5. Compare playlists

- Tracks which are in both playlists.
