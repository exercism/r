# Hints

## General

Return values for the functions are of a specific type, so pay attention.

## 1. Define a named vector

- The necessary information for the names and values is in the instructions.
- The way to construct a named vector is covered in detail in the introduction.

## 2. Return the value associated with a band

- You can use your `resistor_bands` named vector to accomplish this easily.
- You need to return a numeric value alone.

## 3. Return the value associated with two bands

- Your `band_value` function can come in handy here.
- Indexing hints for named vectors are in the introduction.
- There are several ways to construct the number, most commonly via string manipulation or numerically.
- The returned number must be a numeric value alone.

## 4. Return the ohms associated with all three bands

- Both `band_value` and `two_band_value` are useful here.
- The first two values in the vector are for the two-band value, while the third is the multiplier.
- Again, string manipulation or numerical means are possible to get the number.
- The returned number must be a numeric value alone.
