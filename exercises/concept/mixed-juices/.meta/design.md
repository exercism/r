# Design

## Goal

The goal of this exercise is to teach the student the use of `loops` in R, as well as practicing `switch()` learned previously.

## Learning objectives

- Know the ways to iterate over a vector, with a simple `in` and with `seq_along`.
- Know the syntax of `while` and `repeat` loops, including `break` and `continue`.
- Know that loops are less common in R than in most other languages.

## Out of scope

- Avoiding explicit loops with the `apply()` family of functions.

## Concepts

This exercise unlocks no other concepts.

## Prerequisites

- `switch`
