# Design

## Goal

The goal of this exercise is to teach the student the use of booleans in R.

## Learning objectives

- Know that boolean vaues are `TRUE` and `FALSE`
- Know that negation uses the `!` operator
- Know that `&&` and `||` can be used for boolean `and` and `or` 

## Out of scope

- Use of comparison operators and if/else logic will be covered in the `conditionals` concept.
- Though the vector operators `&` and `|` are mentioned for completeness in the concept's `about.md`, they are not part of this exercise and will only be discussed after introducing `vectors`.

## Concepts

The Concepts this exercise unlocks are:

- `conditionals` : comparisons, if-else and `ifelse()`

## Prerequisites

- `basics`
