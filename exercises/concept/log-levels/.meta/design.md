# Design

## Goal

The goal of this exercise is to introduce the student to string-handling functions in R.

Both legacy functions in base R, and the newer/better options in `stringr` are covered.
Students can use either to solve the exercise, and the exemplar has working code for both approaches.

## Learning objectives

- Understand `nchar()` (or `str_length()`) versus `length()`
- Understand legacy string functions, and why they are still somewhat relevant.
- Understand the `stringr` library, and why this is preferred for non-trivial new code.

## Out of scope

- A full discussion of pattern searching is postponed to the `regular-expressions` concept.
- Discussion of `lists` as return values, beyond the necessary minimum.

## Concepts

The concepts this exercise unlocks are:

- `nothingness`
- `randomness`
- `regular-expressions`

## Prerequisites

- `vectors`
