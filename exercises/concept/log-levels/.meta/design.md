# Design

## Goal

The current goal of this exercise is to introduce the student to string-handling finctions in core R.

In an ideal world it would cover `stringr` as the preferred alternative, but Docker seems to be blocking that package in the test runner for now.

## Learning objectives

- Understand `nchar()` versus `length()`
- Understand `paste()` and `sprintf()` to construct strings.
- Understand `substr()` and `strsplit()` to get parts of a string.
- Understand `trimws()` to remove whitespace.

## Out of scope

- `grep()`, `regexexpr()` and `gregexpr()` are postponed to the `regular-expressions` concept.
- Discussion of `lists` as return values, beyond the necessary minimum.

## Concepts

The concepts this exercise unlocks are:

- `nothingness`
- `randomness`
- `regular-expressions`

## Prerequisites

- `vectors`
