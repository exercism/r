## General

- Knowledge of regular expressions is not required or expected for this exercise.
- However, students who already have regex experience are free to use it if they wish.

## 1. Get message from a log line

- Think about how to split the log line into useful parts.
- You may need to remove excess whitespace.

## 2. Get log level from a log line

- There are various ways to pull out the desired substring, but position index may be simplest.
- Remember to change case.

## 3. Reformat a log line

- You already wrote functions to do much of the work, and using those will help you.
- Join the pieces back together, with some extra punctuation.
