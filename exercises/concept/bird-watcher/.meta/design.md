# Design

## Goal

The goal of this exercise is to build on the `vectors` concept by teaching the student more about vector filtering/subsetting in R. It is the second exercise on this concept, after `elyses-analytic-enchantments`.

## Learning objectives

- Practice the use of conditional expressions to get a subset of the original vector.

## Out of scope

- Recycling is not mentioned within this exercise, though it is explained in `vector-filtering/about.md` which unlocks on completing this exercise.

## Concepts

The Concepts this exercise unlocks are:

- `vector-functions`
- `nothingness`

## Prerequisites

- `vectors`
