# Design

## Goal

The goal of this exercise is to build on the `vector-filtering` concept by teaching the student more about vectorized functions in R.
It is the third exercise on this concept, after `elyses-analytic-enchantments`.

## Learning objectives

- Practice the use of built-in functions to operate on a vector.

## Out of scope

- Higher order functions such as `lapply` or the `purrr` library.

## Concepts

The Concepts this exercise unlocks are:

***To be determined***

## Prerequisites

- `vector-filtering`
