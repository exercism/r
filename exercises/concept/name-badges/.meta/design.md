# Design

## Goal

The goal of this exercise is to teach the student about the various forms of nothingness in R.

## Learning objectives

- Understand `NULL` as the absence of a value.
- Understand `NA` as a placeholder for a missing value.
- Understand the basics of how to test for and respond to these values.
- Understand that R tries to flag these values in-place *without* throwing an exception: a data-science approach rather than a computer-science approach.

## Out of scope

- `NaN` and `Inf` as flagging invalid numbers, though this is mentioned in the concept's `about.md`. Omitting these is purely pragmatic, with no obvious way to include them in the exercise.
- The greater importance of this concept in more complex structures such as `dataframes`. At this stage, the discussion is limited to vectors.

## Concepts

- `errors`

## Prerequisites

- `vector-filtering`
- `strings`
