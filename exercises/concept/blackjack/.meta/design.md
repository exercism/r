# Design

## Goal

The goal of this exercise is to teach the student the use of `switch()` in base R, and the `dplyr` functions `case_match()` and `case_when()`.

## Learning objectives

- Know the syntax of a `switch()`.
- Know that this is most often used with string values, where the quotes can be omitted.
- Know that a default is possible when switching on strings, but this is always `NULL` when switching on integers.
- Know that `case_match()` is a vectorized form of switch, with somewhat different syntax.
- Know that `case_when()` allows much more versatile pattern matching.

## Out of scope

Use of `case_when()` with string functions and regular expressions is introduced briefly in the About, but is not part of the exercise (perhaps unfortunately).

## Concepts

The Concepts this exercise unlocks are:

- `loops`

## Prerequisites

- `strings`
