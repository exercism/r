# Design

## Goal

The goal of this exercise is to teach the student the use of `switch()` in R, as well as practicing conditional branching learned previously.

## Learning objectives

- Know the syntax of a `switch()`.
- Know that this is most often used with string values, where the quotes can be omitted.
- Know that a default is possible when switching on strings, but this is always `NULL` when switching on integers.

## Out of scope

Nothing relevant to R was deliberately excluded, as this topic is relatively self-contained.

## Concepts

The Concepts this exercise unlocks are:

- `loops`

## Prerequisites

- `conditionals`
