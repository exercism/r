# Design

## Goal

The goal of this exercise is to teach the student about conditionals in R. It provides additional practice after `vehicle-purchase`.

## Learning objectives

- Know that the relational operators are `==`, `!=`, `>=`, `<=`.
- Know the syntax of a block if-else.

## Out of scope

- Use of `ifelse()`, which is postponed to `vector-filtering`.
- String concatenation/interpolation (removed from part 2 of the exercise after forking)

## Concepts

The Concepts this exercise unlocks are:

- `vectors`
- `loops`
- `switch`

## Prerequisites

- `booleans`
