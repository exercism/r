# Secret Handshake

> There are 10 types of people in the world: Those who understand
> binary, and those who don't.

You and your fellow cohort of those in the "know" when it comes to
binary decide to come up with a secret "handshake".

```text
1 = wink
10 = double blink
100 = close your eyes
1000 = jump


10000 = Reverse the order of the operations in the secret handshake.
```

Given a decimal number, convert it to the appropriate sequence of events for a secret handshake.

Here's a couple of examples:

Given the input 3, the function would return the array
["wink", "double blink"] because 3 is 11 in binary.

Given the input 19, the function would return the array
["double blink", "wink"] because 19 is 10011 in binary.
Notice that the addition of 16 (10000 in binary)
has caused the array to be reversed.

## Installation
See [this guide](https://github.com/exercism/xr/blob/master/docs/INSTALLATION.md) for instructions on how to setup your local R environment.

## How to implement your solution
In each problem folder, there is a file named `<exercise_name>.R` containing a function that returns a `NULL` value. Place your implementation inside the body of the function.

## How to run tests
Inside of RStudio, simply execute the `test_<exercise_name>.R` script. This can be conveniently done with [testthat's `auto_test` function](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/testthat/topics/auto_test). Because exercism code and tests are in the same folder, use this same path for both  `code_path` and `test_path` parameters. On the command-line, you can also run `Rscript test_<exercise_name>.R`.
