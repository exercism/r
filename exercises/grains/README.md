# Grains

Calculate the number of grains of wheat on a chessboard given that the number
on each square doubles.

There once was a wise servant who saved the life of a prince. The king
promised to pay whatever the servant could dream up. Knowing that the
king loved chess, the servant told the king he would like to have grains
of wheat. One grain on the first square of a chess board. Two grains on
the next. Four on the third, and so on.

There are 64 squares on a chessboard.

Write code that shows:
- how many grains were on each square, and
- the total number of grains

## For bonus points

Did you get the tests passing and the code clean? If you want to, these
are some additional things you could try:

- Optimize for speed.
- Optimize for readability.

Then please share your thoughts in a comment on the submission. Did this
experiment make the code better? Worse? Did you learn anything from it?

## Installation
See [this guide](https://exercism.io/tracks/r/installation) for instructions on how to setup your local R environment.

## How to implement your solution
In each problem folder, there is a file named `<exercise_name>.R` containing a function that returns a `NULL` value. Place your implementation inside the body of the function.

## How to run tests
Inside of RStudio, simply execute the `test_<exercise_name>.R` script. This can be conveniently done with [testthat's `auto_test` function](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/testthat/topics/auto_test). Because exercism code and tests are in the same folder, use this same path for both `code_path` and `test_path` parameters. On the command-line, you can also run `Rscript test_<exercise_name>.R`.
