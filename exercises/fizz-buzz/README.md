# Fizz Buzz

Print numbers from 1 to n with the following exceptions:

1. When a number is a multiple of 3, then print "Fizz"
2. When a number is a multiple of 5, then print "Buzz"
3. When a number is both a multiple of 3 and a multiple of 5, then print "Fizz Buzz"

The output should be a vector of strings, such as, "1" "2" "Fizz" "4" "Buzz" ...

## Installation
See [this guide](https://exercism.io/tracks/r/installation) for instructions on how to setup your local R environment.

## How to implement your solution
In each problem folder, there is a file named `<exercise_name>.R` containing a function that returns a `NULL` value. Place your implementation inside the body of the function.

## How to run tests
Inside of RStudio, simply execute the `test_<exercise_name>.R` script. This can be conveniently done with [testthat's `auto_test` function](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/testthat/topics/auto_test). Because Exercism code and tests are in the same folder, use this same path for both `code_path` and `test_path` parameters. On the command-line, you can also run `Rscript test_<exercise_name>.R`.
