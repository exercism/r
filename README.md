### Asking for help
If stuck or in doubt just ask! We try our best to be friendly and helpful, so don't be shy!
- [gitter support](https://gitter.im/exercism/support): general questions about Exercism, setup, track content, etc.
- [gitter dev](https://gitter.im/exercism/dev): technical questions.

### How to contribute
As a first step we recommend you read the [contributing guide](https://github.com/exercism/docs/blob/master/contributing-to-language-tracks/README.md).

#### Reporting or fixing bugs
Typical examples for a bug: A typo, a missing test case, an unclear or ambiguous problem description.
- If you are unsure whether you have really found a bug [just ask](#asking-for-help).
- To report a bug you can [write an issue](#writing-an-issue).
- If you have a fix you can [write a pull request](#writing-a-pull-request).

#### Reviewing issues and pull requests
If you have a dedicated opinion you are welcome to [write a comment](https://help.github.com/articles/commenting-on-a-pull-request/) for an [issue](https://github.com/exercism/r/issues) or a [pull request](https://github.com/exercism/r/pulls).
Please be detailed and include motivations or relevant links to support your opinion.

#### Porting exercises
See here for more information about [porting an exercise](https://github.com/exercism/docs/blob/master/you-can-help/implement-an-exercise-from-specification.md).
Of course you can also add a totally new exercise, but it might be a good idea to first discuss it in one of [our forums](#asking-for-help).

#### Updating an exercise test suite
Updating the test suite of an existing exercise is a special case because it usually affects all languages. Read more about it [here](https://github.com/exercism/docs/blob/master/contributing-to-language-tracks/README.md#updating-an-exercise-test-suite).
Note that the test suite must run within a couple of seconds.

### Repository structure and conventions
A general description of all the files and directories can be found [here](https://github.com/exercism/docs/blob/master/contributing-to-language-tracks/README.md#track-anatomy).

#### Directory structure
```bash
├── .gitignore
├── .travis.yml
├── .github
│ └── stale.yml
├── config.json
├── README.md
└── LICENSE
├── img
│ └── icon.png
├── bin

│ ├── run_lints.R
│ └── run_tests.R
├── docs

└── exercises
  ├── TRACK_HINTS.md

  │ ├── example.R
  │ └── test_<exercise-name>.R
  ├── <exercise-name>
  │ ├── <exercise-name>.R
  │ ├── example.R
  │ └── test_<exercise-name>.R
  └── ...
```
- `config.json`: Note that every exercise has to be registered here, with a unique name and a difficulty. The sequence order in this file determines the default order in which the exercises are fetched.

#### Exercise structure
Each exercise has the following structure:
- `<exercise-name>.R` usually contains an empty function declaration, as a starting point for the required solution.
- `example.R` is the source code of the sample solution.
- `test_<exercise-name>.R` is the [test suite](#test-suite).
- `HINTS.md` is an optional file containing instructions and/or hints. It is used together with the respective `description.md` for the exercise from [problem-specifications](https://github.com/exercism/problem-specifications) to build the `README.md` file.

### Writing an issue
To report a bug you should [create an issue](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-issue/) [here](https://github.com/exercism/r/issues).

### Writing a pull request
To fix a bug you should [create a pull request from a fork](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork/) from [here](https://github.com/exercism/r/pulls). See also [our Git Basics information](https://github.com/exercism/docs/blob/master/contributing/git-basics.md).

### Development dependencies
You'll need to have a recent version of [R](https://cran.r-project.org/) installed on your system, as well as the `testthat` package (run `install.packages('testthat')` from the R console to install) in order to run tests.

Optionally, you may also want to install [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) in order to make use of the suggested pre-commit hooks (these will assist with automated code style checks etc). See the [Style Guide](#style-guide) for more info.

### Example solution
The example solution doesn't have to be perfect, but should pass all of the tests and ideally also strive for a healthy balance of human readability and computational efficiency.

### Test suite
The test suite should be derived from the respective `problem-specifications/exercises/<exercise-name>/canonical-data.json` and comply to some formatting and coding standards (to get an idea you can look at some of the existing tests).

### Running tests
To run the tests for just a single exercise, run `source('test_<exercise-name>.R')` from within the exercise's directory. Note that when testing locally you'll need to replace the first line of `test_<exercise-name>.R` (which sources `<exercise-name>.R`) with `source('example.R')`. If you do this, remember to change it back before submitting any pull requests.

Alternatively, to run tests for all exercises at once, simply run `source("bin/run_tests.R")`.

The example solutions must pass the tests without failures. Additionally the tests should not run longer than a few seconds.

In order to be accepted by Travis-CI, each exercise must be registered in `config.json`.

### Style guide
There are a variety of R style guides in circulation and opinions on the topic can vary widely which does make it hard to settle on specific standards. Our preference is to have R code in this repository follow the [tidyverse style guide](http://style.tidyverse.org/).

You are thus encouraged to run [`lintr`](https://github.com/jimhester/lintr) on your R scripts before opening a [pull request](#writing-a-pull-request) in order to check that your code adheres to this style guide before submitting it for review.

Note however that at the moment only the following linting rules are strictly enforced:

- line length should be less than 80 characters
- objects should not be in camelCase, snake_case is preferred
- the assignment operator <- should be used
- all commas should be followed by a space (but not preceded by one)
- no absolute paths should be used
- infix operators (+, -, =, <-) should have spaces around them

To perform these specific checks locally, run `source("bin/run_lints.R")`.

We also recommend using [styler](https://github.com/r-lib/styler). You can have styler run automatically (when making code commits) by making use of a [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com) hook.

Simply follow the installation instructions available [here](https://pre-commit.com/#install)
and then from the terminal run `pre-commit install` in your repo. The hooks defined in `.pre-commit-config.yaml` will then run automatically on any subsequent commits. This should help deal with most of the linting requirements.

You can run `pre-commit autoupdate` occasionally to update the hook revisions.
