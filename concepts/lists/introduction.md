# Introduction

A `list` in R is an ordered collection of items, differing from `vectors` in a few ways:
- The items can be of different types (e.g. mixing `numeric` with `character`).
- The items can be complex structures (e.g. vectors, other lists, etc).
- There is some different syntax for accessing elements.

Analogies to other languages are imprecise. 
An R `list` is somewhat similar to a Python dictionary, but the `list` is ordered and can be accessed by numerical index.
It is somewhat similar to a C `struct`, except that the `list` can easily be extended at runtime.

## Creating lists

Giving names (often called "tags") to the elements is more common with lists than with vectors:

```R
> list(x = 5.3, y = 4.2, color = "blue")
$x
[1] 5.3

$y
[1] 4.2

$color
[1] "blue"
```

However, tags are optional and R will then just use index numbers:

```R
> list(5.3, 4.2, "blue")
[[1]]
[1] 5.3

[[2]]
[1] 4.2

[[3]]
[1] "blue"
```

## Accessing list elements

There are three ways to do this, each useful in different contexts.

### 1. With `$tag` notation

Very common if the tag names are known in advance.

```R
> point <- list(x = 5.3, y = 4.2, color = "blue")
> point$x
[1] 5.3
> point$color
[1] "blue"
```

### 2. With `[[tag]]` notation

This has the advantage that the tag name can be chosen at runtime. Note the double brackets.

```R
> want <- "y"
> point[[want]] # same as point$y
[1] 4.2
```

### 3. With position index

This works whether or not the list has tags. Again, brackets are doubled.

```R
> point[[3]] # same as point$color
[1] "blue"
```

## Adding and deleting elements

Simple: assigning to an element will modify if it exists or add if it is new.

```R
> point$color <- "red"
> point$trust <- TRUE
> point
$x
[1] 5.3

$y
[1] 4.2

$color
[1] "red"

$trust
[1] TRUE
```

To delete, assign `NULL` to the unwanted element.

```R
> point$trust <- NULL
> point
$x
[1] 5.3

$y
[1] 4.2

$color
[1] "red"
```
