R is a free, open source, programming language and software environment for statistical computing and graphics developed at Bell Laboratories as a GNU project. It is designed as a true computer language, and is written in C, Fortran and R.

R provides a wide variety of statistical (linear and nonlinear modelling, classical statistical tests, time-series analysis, classification, clustering, etc) and graphical techniques, and is highly extensible.

One of its strengths is the ease with which well-designed publication-quality plots can be produced, including mathematical symbols and formulae where needed. Great care has been taken over the defaults for the minor design choices in graphics, but the user retains full control. Along with this, for computationally-intensive tasks, C, C++ and Fortran can be linked and called at runtime or one can even write C code to manipulate R objects directly.

The R software suite includes:
* An effective data handling and storage facility,
* A suite of operators for calculations on arrays, in particular matrices,
* A large, coherent, integrated collection of intermediate tools for data analysis,
* graphical facilities for data analysis and display either on-screen or on hardcopy, and
* A well-developed, simple and effective programming language which includes conditionals, loops, user-defined recursive functions and input and output facilities.
* The term “environment” is intended to characterize it as a fully planned and coherent system, rather than an incremental accretion of very specific and inflexible tools, as is frequently the case with other data analysis software.
* R can be extended (easily) via packages. There are about eight packages supplied with the R distribution and many more are available through the CRAN family of Internet sites covering a very wide range of modern statistics.
