R is an open source programming language that is the *lingua franca* of statistics. It was created by **R**oss Ihaka and **R**obert Gentleman at the University of Auckland, who wanted a language that was better suited to statistical computing and easier to use than comparable software designed by computer scientists.

It's worth noting however, that R is not just a programming language, but also an environment for interactive data analysis. Its powerful metaprogramming capabilities allow for magically succinct and concise functions. It has also been designed to leverage high-performance programming languages like C, Fortran, and C++. These combined attributes provide an excellent environment for designing domain-specific languages.

Ross Ihaka describes R as "a real demonstration of the power of collaboration". R has a fantastic community of both users and developers, who contribute to a massive (and rapidly growing) collection of packages for importing, manipulating and visualising data, as well as cutting edge methods for statistical modelling and machine learning.
