R is an open source programming language for data analysis and statistical computing. It was created by Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman at the University of Auckland, and is an implementation of the S programming language combined with lexical scoping semantics inspired by Scheme. The language is interpreted, dynamically typed, and has a strong foundation in functional programming. This makes it well suited to many of the challenges of data analysis.

It's worth noting however, that R is not just a programming language, but also an environment for interactive data analysis. Its powerful metaprogramming capabilities allow for magically succinct and concise functions. It has also been designed to leverage high-performance programming languages like C, Fortran, and C++. These combined attributes provide an excellent environment for designing domain-specific languages.

R has a fantastic community of both users and developers, who contribute to a massive (and rapidly growing) collection of packages for importing, manipulating and visualising data, as well as cutting edge methods for statistical modelling and machine learning.
